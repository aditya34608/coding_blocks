/*
Shekhar is a bomb defusal specialist. He once encountered a bomb that can be defused only by a secret code. He is given a number N and a number K. 
And he is also given permutation of first N natural numbers . The defusal code is the largest permutation possible by doing atmost K swaps among a pair of the given permutation. Help him to find the final permutation.

Input Format

First line contains â€‹an integer N and an integer k. The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the given permutation.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^5 1<= K <= 10^9

Output Format

The final permutation of the numbers with every number separated by a space with other number.

Sample Input

5 2
3 4 1 2 5

Sample Output

5 4 3 2 1

Explanation

First we can swap 5 with 3 which gives us 5 4 1 2 3 and then we can swap 3 and 1 which gives us 5 4 3 2 1.
